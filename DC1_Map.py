# This file is designed to abstract away all of messy coding to customize your controller.
#
# First, you will need to reference your CNTRL:R's hard-coded MIDI assignments (internal to the controller itself).
# By default (if you haven't messed around with the CNTRL:R editor and sent the changes) you can find them here:
# http://wiki.lividinstruments.com/wiki/File:CNTRLR_MIDI_Defaults.png
# By default, all buttons (the 4x4, 16x2, and push-buttons on the center encoders are of type "Note." All encoders/faders themselves are of type "CC."
#
# If you change these in the CNTRL:R editor, you will need to refer to those instead...
#
# Color/flashing light conventions:
# 7 colors available: C_OFF (LED off), C_YELLOW, C_CYAN, C_VIOLET, C_RED, C_GREEN, C_WHITE
# 3 blinking speeds available (you can modify CNTRL_R_LITE_DEFS.py to add more/tweak these): S_FAST, S_MED, S_SLOW
# To make a color blink, just add to it it's speed variable.
#
# Assignment examples:
# SOMEBUTTON = C_CYAN (the button will be statically lit cyan)
# SOMEBUTTON = C_YELLOW+S_MED (the button will blink yellow at a medium rate)
#
# You can add other speeds/tweak the defined speeds in CNTRL_R_LITE_DEFS.py
#

# PART 1: Setting up your session view (the red box / clip grid) if you want it. 
# Default in this script is to use CNTRL:R's 4x4 grid, but you could *easily* modify this to use the 16x2 grid, or any other combo.

# TRACK_CLIP_BUTTONS layout is laid out as [TRACK1 buttons | TRACK2 buttons | etc]

# PART 2: Setting up your basic mixer controls. The mixer is comprised of channel strips (like on a real mixer) in live. 
# This will allow you to give mixer control over your session view. Specifically: Volume, Mute, Solo, Sends.
# Each track on the mixer will correspond to a track in our session view. This means, if you assign a button to Mute on the first track in this mixer,
# it will control the first ** SESSION VIEW TRACK** (not the global track number) in Ableton Live. So if you move the red box around, the button assignment will update accordingly.

# NOTE: If turned on, this will create a mixer that is the same size as N_TRACKS. If you do something like create a 16x2 clip nav grid in Part 1 - it's OK - you're not obligated to
# assign knobs/faders for everything.


# The SEND_ENCODERS assumes the format: 
#[<track 1 send 1>,...,<track 1 send N>,<track 2 send 1>,...,<track 2 send N>,......,<track N send N>

# e.g. if SEND_ENCODERS=[Some Number 1,Some Number 2,Some Number 3], and N_SENDS = 3, and N_TRACKS = 5
# this will just assign encoders to the sends of the first track. The rest will be unassigned.
